#Submarine Cable Taps

[Documents](http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/103543418200/snowden-leaks-how-vodafone-subsidiary-cable) published on November 25, 2014 by *SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung* revealed more specific details about submarine cables currently tapped by GCHQ. [Previous reporting](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/26/snowden_doc_leak_lists_all_the_compromised_cables/) had made it clear that GCHQ had submarine cable taps created in collusion with companies like Vodafone and BT Cable, but not which specific cables. 

Seeing Telegeography publishes landing point maps and [submarine cable maps](http://submarinecablemap.com) it seemed like a worthwhile exercise to better understand what, exactly, the reach of GCHQ's submarine cable tapping might look like. 

##Some caution

Initial methods are very, very messy here. There's a lot of data cleanup that is probably going to need to happen. Reasons for the messiness:

- The PDF list of cables was hella dirty and it OCR-ed poorly, there's the possibility of manual cleanup errors.
- Names of cables in the GCHQ doc are not always exactly matched up to cables in the Telegeography data. I did a sloppy table join and I need to go through and actually check that I got everything. 

What I'm saying is don't just run with this dataset, it really needs some thorough double-checking. 

##Onward.
